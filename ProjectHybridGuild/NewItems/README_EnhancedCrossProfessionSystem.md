# Enhanced Cross-Profession Ingredient System

This system adds logical ingredients and creates interconnected chains between professions at low and mid-tier levels (Tier 1-6), making the economy more realistic and engaging.

## Overview

The enhanced ingredient system introduces **28 new items** that create meaningful connections between professions, requiring players to either develop multiple professions or trade with others to access advanced recipes.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Logical Ingredients**: All recipes use realistic components (eggs in bread, salt for preservation, etc.)
2. **Cross-Profession Dependencies**: Items require materials from multiple professions
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Higher tier items require more ingredients from more professions
4. **Tool Integration**: Professional tools provide meaningful productivity bonuses
5. **Economic Interconnection**: Creates trade opportunities between player dynasties

## Basic Ingredient Foundation (Tier 1-2)

### Core Ingredients
- **Salt** (Mason) - Essential for food preservation and flavoring
- **Yeast** (Shaman) - Required for bread making and brewing
- **Milk** (Farm) - From cattle, used in dairy products and cooking
- **Butter** (Butcher) - Made from milk and salt, essential for rich foods

These four ingredients form the foundation of most enhanced recipes and create immediate cross-profession dependencies.
