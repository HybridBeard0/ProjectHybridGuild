# NewItems Mod - Missing Icons Summary

## Overview
The NewItems mod for The Guild 3 introduces **47 new items** across multiple profession extensions, but currently lacks the required icon files for proper display in-game.

## Files Created

### 1. ItemIconsDefinition.inc
- Contains updated item definitions with proper `IconName` entries
- Includes descriptive comments for each icon's visual design
- Ready to integrate into existing mod files

### 2. MissingIconsList.md
- Complete catalog of all 47 missing icons
- Detailed descriptions for each icon
- Design guidelines and implementation notes
- Priority levels for development

### 3. generate_icons.py
- Python script to help manage icon creation process
- Checks for missing vs existing icons
- Generates manifest files and batch scripts
- Provides priority ordering for development

## Quick Action Items

### Immediate (High Priority - 13 icons)
Combat and core crafting items that affect gameplay balance:
- SteelIngot, RoyalLongsword, RoyalMace, RoyalPlatemail, RoyalShield, RoyalRapier, RoyalCrossbow
- KnowledgeCrystal, PrecisionTools, PhilosophersStone
- EnhancedBreadRoll, EnhancedWheatBread, RoyalCake

### Medium Priority (17 icons)

### Low Priority (17 icons)

## Technical Requirements

### Icon Specifications:
- **Resolution**: 64x64 pixels
- **Format**: .dds (preferred) or .tga
- **Style**: Medieval/Renaissance, consistent with Guild 3
- **Location**: Game's `UI/Icons/` directory

### Integration Steps:
1. Create icon files following the specifications
2. Place icons in proper game directory
3. Update item definitions with `IconName` entries
4. Test in-game display and inventory functionality

## Impact Assessment

### Without Icons:
- Items display with generic/missing icon placeholders
- Reduced visual clarity in inventory management
- Poor user experience for mod content
- Professional presentation issues

### With Icons:
- Full visual integration with base game
- Clear item identification and categorization
- Enhanced user experience
- Professional mod presentation

## Development Workflow

1. **Start with high-priority icons** (combat items and basic food)
2. **Create in batches** by category for consistency
3. **Test each batch** in-game before proceeding
4. **Document any adjustments** needed for visual clarity
5. **Package final icons** with mod distribution

## Resource Requirements

- **Art software**: Capable of creating 64x64 .dds/.tga files
- **Reference materials**: Existing Guild 3 icons for style consistency
- **Testing environment**: Guild 3 with mod loading capability
- **Time estimate**: 2-4 hours per icon for quality artwork

## Next Steps

1. **Review the MissingIconsList.md** for complete specifications
2. **Run generate_icons.py** to create helper files and check progress
3. **Begin icon creation** starting with high-priority items
4. **Test integration** with ItemIconsDefinition.inc updates
5. **Update mod documentation** once icons are complete

The NewItems mod represents a significant content expansion for Guild 3, and proper icon implementation will greatly enhance its professional quality and user experience.
